### Origins 

The Berkeley Out-of-Order RISC-V Processor is a open source parameterizable core written in [Chisel](https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/).
Created at the University of California, Berkeley in the [Berkeley Architecture Research](https://bar.eecs.berkeley.edu/) group, its focus was to create a high 
performance, synthesizable, and parameterizable core for architecture research.
